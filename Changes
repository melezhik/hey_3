Revision history for Hey

## [1.0.0-beta.5] - 2022-12-17
ADDED
- Tests! Most everything has test coverage now, except for the backdating and date specification in logs. PRs welcome.
- Ability to specify sorting when retrieving events.

CHANGED
- Log output now has "concise" durations.
  Ex. "2 hours and 23 minutes" is now written as "2h23m".
  Note: that's a bit too "consice" for my liking but it's what the
  library offered.
- Table generators are no longer overriding sorting of the list passed
  in.
- MAJOR refactoring. Took most of the methods out of
  `Database.rakumod` and moved them into domain specific files.
- Now prints out nice message instead of empty table when there are no
  timers or interrupts recorded in the specified duration.
- logs now use 12hr time with AM/PM designation.

FIXED
- changed the logging to use cultural durations instead of literal.
  See README for details. tl;dr: 1 day gets you today. 1 week gets you
this week. Hours, minutes, and seconds are literal amounts.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2022-12-16
ADDED
- now you can kill a specific timer

FIXED
- corrected edge case with adjusting time post noon.
- corrected bug in a couple places where only the first row of a query was being returned

CHANGED
- Removed summary from all tables
  It wasn't wrapping and looked terrible.
  Will reinstate once i get the wrapping working again.
- Improved output
  - Now specifes id of newly created timer
  - Now sorts people, projects, & tags in table views
- Exit code for user error is now 64
